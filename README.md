# Localized-Factor-Model

This repo contains the C code for fitting the localized factor model for multi-context recommendation.

It was my undergraduate thesis project. I wrote the code and used it to study the model’s performance in the presence of cold-start users and noisy features。 

The paper that introduces the model and the fitting algorithm can be found here:
